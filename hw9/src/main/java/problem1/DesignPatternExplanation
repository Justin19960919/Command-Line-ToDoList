Singleton pattern:
  For the Options class, it represents the list of option that the parser may encounter and process.
  These information won't change during the life time of the program. So only one instance of the
  Options class is needed to coordinate actions across the program. Thus, in Main class, I created a
  static private field to store the instance of Options. No matter how many parser objects are
  being created, they all use the same instance of Options.
